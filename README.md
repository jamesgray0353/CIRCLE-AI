## Case Study
Circular Innovation Recycling Classification & Learning Engine - We want to analyze how well patents in solid-state-battery technology are considering the recycling aspect. We think this is highly relevant, as this technology might become disruptive to the current lithium battery technology, and the large amount of such batteries produced might have significant environmental impact. The approach is easily expandable to other technologies and aspects of interests. By mapping the patents to their owners people can also check which companies are most engage in circular innovation - and if this engagement relates to their enviromental engagement claims.
